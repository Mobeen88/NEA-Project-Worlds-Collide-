# Worlds-Collide | 2D Hack & Slash Game
My first game project â€” *World Collide*, a hack-and-slash adventure where the main goal is to defeat enemies.  
This project was built as a way to learn and experiment with **Pygame**, focusing on combat mechanics, player movement, enemy tracking/pathfinding, and creating visually engaging gameplay.
